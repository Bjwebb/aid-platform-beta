## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

Beta version of the DFID Aid Information Platform

## <a name="project-management"></a> Project Management

The project uses a minimum set of tools to allow us to manage the project.  If you need access to any of these talk to James, Alison or John

- Trello (Product Backlog and Planning) - [Aid Platform Beta Board](https://trello.com/dfid)
- HipChat (Team Communication) (__PENDING__)
- Github (Version Control, Issues, Pull Requests) - [Aid Platform Beta](https://github.com/DFID/aid-platform-beta)

### <a name="key-dates"></a> Key Dates

### <a name="expected-holidays"></a> Expected Holidays

### <a name="trello-boards"></a> Trello Boards

A number of trello boards have been created to facilitate project planning and management.  It is intended these will be refined over time.  In order to facilitate sprint planning and estimation it is possible to use the Chrome based [Scrum Plugin for Trello](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrum-for-trello/jdbcdblgjdpmfninkoogcfpnkjmndgje?hl=en) though not essential.

__[Outstanding Questions](https://trello.com/board/outstanding-questions/5107b23cba70c4eb7b00a1d6)__

In order to ensure the need to "get our data right" doesn'tpollute the product backlog or sprints there is a separate board for any data related or project related questions.

__[Product Backlog](https://trello.com/board/product-backlog/5107b28fe4ed2cd07b00381a)__

The product backlog represents all the items to potentially include in the Beta release.  It uses the following lists,

- Ideas - Coarse grained items to bring into the beta.  Not necessarily fully understood or ready yet but roughly prioritized
- Ready - Features/Chores that are defined enough (Definition of Ready) that can be worked on by the Dev Team
- Sprint Candidates - Items in here will be used for sprint planning - should be __prioritized__ as best as possible
- Live - Items that have been successfully delivered during a sprint.

The __Sprint Candidates__ list will be used as a basis for sprint planning.  Items from this list can be moved into the current sprints initial list once estimated.

__[Sprint](https://trello.com/board/sprint-1/5107b4bee77a73bb56009a41)__

The sprint boards will be used by the team to ensure they are on track to deliver everything they brough into the sprint.

- Sprint Backlog - The features and chores that the team will attempt to deliver during this sprint
- In Progress - Items the team are currently working on (it is essential for viibility that we know who is working on feature)
- Delivered - Items that have been completed by the dev team but not yet fully reviewed by the Product Owner
- Accepted - Items that have been accepted by the Product Owner - they will stay here until the end of the sprint and moved during sprint review.  During sprint review these hould be moved to the __Live__ list in the Product Backlog to give us an overall view of the current state of the system
- Rejected - Items that have been rejected by the Product Owner (incomplete, broken etc.).  These should be reviewed an moved back to the Product Backlog board (Either Sprint Candidates or Ready).


__[Sprint Retrospective](https://trello.com/board/sprint-retrospective-1/5107b4ee7001c21621003df4)__

Feedback in its finest form.

__DON'T READ OTHER FEEDBACK BEFORE WRITING YOUR OWN__

For this activity to work, it's best that you contribute feedback before seeing what others have written.  If you want to hide other feedback, use the "search and filter cards" function on the far right, and search for cards assigned to you.  That should hide all cards, so you can begin writing without distractions. 

> At the end of each Sprint, the team meets for the Sprint Retrospective. In this meeting the team looks in detail at how things went during the Sprint. They determine and commit to specific action items to make things go better. The team may decide to add something to their process. Each addition is made with an eye to improving some specific aspect of things. Perhaps we found that we didn't understand clearly what some of the backlog items meant. We might decide to have testers attend the backlog refinement meeting, so that they can create executable examples of the items working correctly. Or we might find that our specialists are becoming bottlenecks, so we decide that all specialist work will be done with a non-specialist pair programming with a specialist. The team might decide to remove something from their process. Perhaps we find that time spent getting wireframes approved is holding us up, so we decide to just go ahead and build the actual windows simply, so that the UX people can see them, but the testers can start working on them as well.  Sometimes the team may feel that some aspect of Scrum itself is holding them up. When Scrum is hard to do, or seems to be slowing you down, the most likely case is that Scrum has identified an obstacle or impediment in your organization. Is it hard to get people together? That's telling you that you need to get people together, not that you need to figure out a way to limp along with people separated in time and space.

- Successes - Document items that made the sprint successful
- Less than Success - Document items that made the sprint less than successful
- Ah Ha! Moments - Mind Blowing moments you experienced during the sprint
- Appreciations - Mad props to people who deserve it
- Hindered - What hindered the sprint? 
- Hypothesis - What should we try next time?

## <a name="architecture"></a> Architecture

This is the current architectural vision

<img src="https://raw.github.com/DFID/aid-platform-beta/master/lib/images/architecture.png?login=kouphax&token=ab369cd411268e8e3188ec586921cb85" style="width:100%"/>

The technologies suggested are only theoretical and I expect them to change as and when the components evolve.  For now bare minimum spikes through the system are essential to draw out requirements.

- __Loader Admin__ - The alpha provided configuration through a simple file.  The loader admin will be a more user friendly approach to defining what XML files should be loaded as well as providing an area to add "annotations" to the IATI data.
- __Loader__ - The loader pulls in the IATI XML data and loads it into the data stores of the API and Searcher
- __Searcher__ - Provides faceted, fuzzy searching of loaded IATI data.  This is only available to the Platform and not through the API.  The rationale for doing this is that it is very much geared towards the aid-platform format rather than arbitrary API calls.  We can consider exposing this externally as we go on.  Potentially built on top of ElasticSearch.
- __API__ - IATI Data API built against the working draft of the IATI API Standards.  Unlike the beta this wont be tailored specifically to DFIDs assumptions of the data shape.  Extra work will need to be carried out by the aid platform itself
- __Platform__ - The aid platform will consume the API and generate a static site that can be hosted on any provider.

## <a name="development-guidelines"></a> Development Guidelines

### <a id="make-commits-meaningful"></a> Make commits meaningful

Keep the commit tree tidy and meaningful.  GDS have a a [great style guide for Git](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md).  Be descriptive - "fixed bugs" is not good enough :)

### <a id="dont-commit-to-master"></a> Dont commit to master

Use short lived feature branches to work in.  When something is ready to be merged into master [open a pull request](https://github.com/DFID/aid-platform-beta/pull/new/master) vis Github to allow the rest of the team to quickly review it before it goes into master.

### <a id="run-all-tests-before-pushing"></a> Run all the tests before pushing

Don't rely on the CI server to make sure you haven't broken anything.  Be sure to run tests prior to committing and pushing code to Github.
