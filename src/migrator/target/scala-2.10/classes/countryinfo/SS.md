Following the referendum in January 2011, South Sudan became an independent country on 9 July 2011. Decades of war have already left South Sudan with a legacy of chronic poverty, inequality, very few roads or other infrastructure, and continuing insecurity. The new country will face significant challenges in securing a stable, peaceful and prosperous future.  UK aid programmes will focus on improving stability and reducing extreme poverty.  We will spend approximately Â£94 million per year in South Sudan until 2015.
