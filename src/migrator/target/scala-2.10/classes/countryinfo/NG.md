Nigeria is home to 158 million people, but more than 100 million live on less than £1 per day. A stable, better governed and prosperous Nigeria would rapidly reduce poverty. It would also hugely benefit UK trade, energy and security interests, and help reduce crime and illegal migration.  We will spend an average of £250 million per year in Nigeria until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Providing more children with a better education
- Helping Nigeria use its oil revenues to improve the lives of its citizens
- Providing more family planning and better health services to stop women dying in childbirth
- Immunising more children, helping eradicate polio and distributing antimalarial bednets
- Helping millions of people to get a bank account and use financial services to build their savings and small businesses"
