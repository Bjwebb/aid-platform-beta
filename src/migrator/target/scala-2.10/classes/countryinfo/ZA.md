South Africa has the largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and is the only African member of the G20. Yet it continues to face challenges – with nearly 13 million people surviving on less than £1 per day, high youth unemployment and high rates of HIV.  We will spend an average of £19 million per year in South Africa until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Tackling HIV and maternal deaths
- Promoting greater and more inclusive growth
- Taking action against high levels of violence against girls and women
- Encouraging private sector investments in low carbon growth
