Ghana is the proof that development works. Continued economic growth and political stability have combined to put the country on target to halve extreme poverty by 2015. But there is work to do - such as bridging the gap between progress made in the north and south, making sure the revenues from oil resources are used effectively and tackling the key development priorities that are off-track. We will spend an average of £94 million per year in Ghana until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Ensuring that the government of Ghana’s resources are well managed for the benefit of all citizens
- Encouraging enterprise and wealth creation
- Ensuring quality education services
- Reducing maternal mortality and child deaths
