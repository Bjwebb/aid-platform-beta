Ten years after the end of the civil war, real progress is finally being made in tackling maternal mortality, child deaths and malaria. The economy is improving and the country’s natural resources offer an opportunity to provide real wealth creation for all.  We will spend an average of £68 million per year in Sierra Leone until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Improving the delivery of basic services like health, education, and water and sanitation
- Supporting innovative cash transfer schemes in more remote provinces and providing better access to financial services to drive wealth creation
- Supporting free and fair elections in 2012
- Improving access to justice for women and children
- Increasing the transparency of government and the ability of citizens to hold it to account"
