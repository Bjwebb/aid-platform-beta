Kenya has the largest economy in east Africa, but there is a risk that the economic potential will not be realised if political stability cannot be maintained.  UK support in Kenya aims to promote stability – stimulating growth led by business and improving service delivery.  We will spend an average of £128 million per year in Kenya until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Getting more children into school in the poorest areas
- Improving maternal and reproductive health and accelerating progress in fighting malaria
- Creating more jobs for young people
- Developing “safety nets” for the most disadvantaged
- Promoting stability and strengthening accountability"
