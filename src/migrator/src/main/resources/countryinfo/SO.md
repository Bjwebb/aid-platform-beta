Somalia is a failed state suffering from 20 years of conflict leading to a chronic humanitarian crisis. This regional instability threatens the interests of other nations through terrorism, illegal migration and piracy.  UK spending in Somalia will increase significantly over the next four years to help the country become more stable and prosperous. It will reduce the threat it presents to the region and the UK. More than 40% of UK aid to the country will be directed at Somaliland, a more peaceful and democratic self-governing region. Progress there could help stability across the region.  We will spend an average of Â£63 million per year in Somalia until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Addressing the underlying causes of instability by supporting peace and improved governance
