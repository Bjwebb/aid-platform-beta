Significant progress has been made on child health, education and HIV and AIDS in Zambia. However, around eight million people still live below the poverty line and only a quarter of young children have enough to eat.  Private sector investment and increased revenues from mining hold the key to a sustainable graduation from aid. And we will encourage Zambia to harness the transformative power of its own resources.  We will spend an average of Â£59 million per year in Zambia until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Supporting the government of Zambia to deliver better services and make better investment decisions
- Tackling malaria and maternal mortality
- Increasing opportunities for rural wealth creation
