Three out of four people in Mozambique live below the poverty line. Access to even the most basic services – such as water, healthcare and schooling – is limited. We share the country’s ambition to transform itself from a poor and post-conflict nation to a thriving gateway of trade and investment in the region.  UK aid will drive positive change in Mozambique by focusing on the jobs, opportunities and services that people need to beat poverty.  We will spend an average of £83 million per year in Mozambique until 2015.

- Improving access to clean water and sanitation
- Increasing the number of children completing basic education, especially girlsv
