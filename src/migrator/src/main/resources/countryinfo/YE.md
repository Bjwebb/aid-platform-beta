Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East. Its many challenges include high population growth, a broken economy, widespread conflict, and a growing humanitarian crisis.  DFID has a key role to play in helping Yemen to address these challenges. Our programme aims to help meet the immediate needs of the most vulnerable Yemenis and to support Yemen's long-term development, stability and security.  Due to the recent instability, some elements of our programme are on hold where they are unable to operate.

## Top priorities:

- Providing essential humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable Yemenis
- Improving access to basic services, such as education, health and water
- Supporting the political transition process
- Supporting economic recovery and reform"
