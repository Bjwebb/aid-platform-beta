Ethiopia has experienced impressive growth and development in recent years, but its growing population remains poor and vulnerable.  UK aid to Ethiopia will meet the needs of the very poorest and support proven results-driven programmes that will bring healthcare, education and water to millions of people. We will build on recent progress and help accelerate Ethiopia’s transformation to prosperity, stability, security and self-sufficiency.

## Top priorities

- Addressing the underlying causes of poverty and fragility through new support for wealth creation, peace and security and tackling the effects of climate change
- Ensuring better access to basic services, enabling millions of people to go to school, drink clean water and access basic health care
- We will spend an average of £331 million per year in Ethiopia until 2015.
