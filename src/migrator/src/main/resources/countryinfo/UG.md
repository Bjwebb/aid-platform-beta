In 20 years, Uganda has transformed from a failed state to a fast growing economy. But corruption and poor infrastructure have restricted the benefits of economic growth. In the war torn north, poverty levels are nearly twice that of the rest of the country.  We will spend an average of Â£89 million per year in Uganda until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Improving the quality of essential services, especially for the most vulnerable
- Supporting the recovery in northern Uganda
- Improving maternal and reproductive health
- Driving growth through training, job creation, financial services and trade
- Improving government accountability and transparency so that future oil revenues are spent effectively
