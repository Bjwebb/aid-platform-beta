Indonesia is centrally important to the world's efforts to preserve forests and to reduce carbon emissions. To reflect this importance, in April 2011 the UK Climate Change Unit was launched as the single platform for all of the UK's objectives on climate change in Indonesia.  The UK Government has reiterated its intention to support the efforts of developing countries to tackle climate change. It has also stated its intention to engage more effectively with large emerging economies. Indonesia matters on both counts.  Indonesia has made bold commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 41% by 2020, is highly vulnerable to climate change impact and is a key player on international climate change negotiations.
