India is a key strategic partner to the UK and the largest democracy in the Commonwealth. India is growing fast and is making good progress on tackling poverty. However, India is still home to one-third of the world's people living below $1.25 (80 pence) a day and the average income is one third of China's.  We will spend £280 million per year in India until 2015.

We have overhauled the programme to reflect India's rising resources, and to ensure that it represents good value for money for the British taxpayer. As India's economy grows, poverty reduces and India becomes more prominent in world affairs, our development partnership with India will become about sharing expertise, supporting innovation and building skills. Over the next four years our top priorities are as follows.

Focus on the poorest people in India's low income states: UK assistance is benefiting the poorest people in three poor states - Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa - reinforcing the deep, productive partnerships we have built over the last decade

Put women and girls at the heart of our work: the UK is investing in girls' education; access to finance, skills and low carbon energy; safe birth, children by choice and reducing violence against women; children's health and nutrition; and sanitation

Expand the private sector's potential to combat poverty: to support growth in the low income states the UK is developing programmes of pro-poor private investment to deliver jobs, products, infrastructure and basic services

Deepen our engagement with India on global issues where there may be benefits for poor people elsewhere: such as growth and trade, climate change, resource scarcity and health and disease control

Eight states in India are home to 65% of India's poor: a quarter of them located in DFID's three focus states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa). More than half of the young children in Madhya Pradesh are undernourished; and only one in four people in Bihar has access to a toilet.  Poverty reduction in these states remains critical to global success in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Inclusive growth and development is a top priority for the government of India and we are working in partnership to build on their own poverty reduction schemes.
