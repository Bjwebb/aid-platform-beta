Liberia has remained fragile and at risk of instability since the end of the highly destructive civil war in 2003. It has some of the worst infant and maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and access to clean water and adequate sanitation is low in most parts of the country.  We plan to spend Â£8 million per year in the next three years, with a review of the programme in 2012/13.

## Top priorities

- Reducing child and maternal mortality
- Increasing the number of people with access to clean water and sanitation"
