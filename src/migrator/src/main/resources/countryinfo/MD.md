Over 17 years, DFID has supported the implementation of Moldova's strategic priorities as expressed in national development documents. Our office is due to close on 31 MarchÂ  2011.  The closure of our bilateral programme will mark the beginning of a new phase of co-operation between the two countries. The UK will continue to support reform processes, as well as Moldova's deepening integration with the EU, through British Embassy programmes and co-operation at the multilateral level with the EU and other donors.
