The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world and is said to be the worst county in the world to be a woman. If we are to focus aid where it is needed most, Democratic Republic of Congo must be a key priority. Years of conflict have left the country deeply impoverished, without basic services and infrastructure.  We will focus our efforts on delivering more for poor people – promoting economic growth and wealth creation and helping build peace, stability and democracy. Improving the lives of girls and women will be a major priority.  We will spend an average of £198 million per year in Democratic Republic of Congo until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Increasing the number of children going to school, particularly girls
- Helping ensure that everyone has the right to vote in democratic elections
- Improving basic health services and bringing maternal care and family planning services to hundreds of thousands of women
- Working to stop the illegal exploitation of minerals, improving investment opportunities and promoting local and regional trade
- Protecting innocent civilians and reduce sexual violence by helping turn the police into an accountable, community based service
