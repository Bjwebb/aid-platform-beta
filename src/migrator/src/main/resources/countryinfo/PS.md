A resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a high priority for Britain. UK aid is focused on supporting the Palestinian economy, helping to build state institutions and improving security and access to justice as an investment in peace.  We continue to meet the needs of the most vulnerable by helping to provide basic services to people in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and refugees across the region.  We will spend an average of Â£86 million per year in the Occupied Palestinian Territories until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Developing the private sector to stimulate the economy and create jobs
- Giving predictable financial support to the Palestinian Authority to help deliver services to the most vulnerable people
- Improving accountability, security and justice for the Palestinian people
- Providing basic services to refugees across the region through the UN
