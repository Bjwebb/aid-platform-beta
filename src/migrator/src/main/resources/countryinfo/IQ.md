Whilst Iraq continues to recover from conflict, it is a middle income country with large reserves of oil and gas. The country has the potential to deliver its own development over the next decade, and no longer requires direct assistance from DFID. As a result, DFID completed its bilateral development programme in March 2012.  In its final year, DFID's support to Iraq focused on governance reform and wealth creation, alongside continued humanitarian support. 

## Achievements over the past year include:

- Helping the Iraqi government publish its three-year Strategic Government Programme 2011-2014, with clear priorities including on service delivery
- Delivering four expert diagnostic assessments to help the Government of Iraq undertake reforms making it easier to do business and invest in Iraq
- Supplying professional development opportunities and courses for over 3,357 staff and students, through 35 partnerships between Iraqi, UK and other universities
- Providing over 3.3 million vulnerable Iraqi children and their families with humanitarian support, including over two million Iraqi children vaccinated against measles, and 450,000 Iraqis provided with a safe water supply."

The UK will also support Iraq's continued economic development through regional initiatives with the International Monetary Fund, the International Finance Corporation and the Arab Partnership Initiative. This support will help Iraq with reforms for a stable, democratic and prosperous future.  The UK Government's Conflict Pool will continue to focus on stabilisation and conflict prevention. The UK will continue to support Iraqi students to study in the UK through the Chevening Scholarship scheme.
