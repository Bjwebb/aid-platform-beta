Decades of war have left Sudan with a legacy of chronic poverty, inequality, and continuing violence and insecurity. Following a referendum in January 2011, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan on 9 July, completing a historic transition from one country to two.  DFID now has separate offices and programmes in Khartoum and Juba to support the two new countries: Sudan and South Sudan. Ensuring the stability of both countries, reducing the risk of further conflict and tackling extreme poverty will be the principal aims of our assistance in both places.  The UK will spend approximately £46 million per year in Sudan until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Improving security across the country by focusing on conflict reduction and peace-building between Sudan and South Sudan, in the border areas, the East, and in Darfur
- Increasing access to health, water and sanitation, and justice services across all states 
- Responding to ongoing humanitarian needs in Darfur, the Eastern states, and the border areas
- Supporting the development of the national economy post-secession through support such as vocational training and access to finance 
- Encouraging a more equitable and transparent use of the national budget to help reduce extreme poverty"

In Sudan there are high levels of inequality, with many people unable to access basic services: education, health and clean water. This is accompanied by an ongoing fear of further instability and violence. The UK will focus on responding to the underlying causes of conflict and its impact on the poorest and most vulnerable in Sudan - the displaced, women and girls, the urban poor, and the disadvantaged young. We will work to tackle the impact of unequal allocation of finance and unequal access to basic services; to reduce competition for resources such as land and water; and to improve the quality of governance. We will also increase communities' ability to withstand the heaviest costs of conflict.
