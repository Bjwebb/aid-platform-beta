The federation of St Kitts and Nevis is in the eastern Caribbean, and has a population of about 50,000. Its economy depends mainly on tourism, manufacturing and offshore financing.  In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015. As part of this, St Kitts and Nevis will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited St Kitts and Nevis amounted to £1,318,000.

Most people in the Caribbean live less than a mile from the coast and are vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. DFID is helping vulnerable people across the region to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats, which are expected to get worse.

UK aid will provide training, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance to protect the assets and livelihoods of small businesses and farmers when disaster strikes.

We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and to integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions, for example through a study to assess the economic impact of climate change on the country's coastal and marine sector, and a climate change risk atlas for the tourism sector in St Kitts. 

Knowing what problems they might face will make it easier to make a case for action, to mobilise resources to scale up their efforts, and to ensure development gains are not lost. 

In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:

£10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets

£10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union. CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors

£4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.

In St Kitts and Nevis, COMPETE is financing the cost of a plan to make the private sector more competitive. Under CARTFund, we are helping public agencies put legislation in place to implement a trade agreement with Europe, as well as helping the private sector to understand the agreement so that they capitalise on opportunities to export more to Europe and get more investment.

The economy of St Kitts and Nevis has been in decline for a few years and the national debt has grown rapidly. DFID has provided the St Kitts and Nevis Government with an adviser from the International Monetary Fund to improve the Finance Ministry's macro-economic management systems.

The St Kitts and Nevis financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.

In common with the rest of the Caribbean, St Kitts and Nevis suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units in the eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.
