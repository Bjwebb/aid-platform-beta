Decades of repressive military rule, economic mismanagement and internal conflict have left millions of people in Burma trapped in extreme poverty.  We will continue to work as a key part of the UK Government’s effort to secure a peaceful and prosperous Burma with a government that is accountable and respects human rights.  We will spend an average of £46 million per year in Burma until 2015. This support is delivered through the United Nations and reputable international and local NGOs. None of our aid goes through the Burmese Government.
