With Serbia now having recovered from its post-conflict phase and on a path to EU membership, it is no longer in need of this type of direct assistance from DFID and our programme ended in January 2011.  Although DFID activities in Serbia are ending, this is by no means the end of the UK's support. The British Embassy remains open for business and UK funding will continue to reach Serbia through the EU and other multilateral agencies. Some 15% of the money the EU spends in Serbia is from the UK.
