As a result of oil wealth, Angola has approached lower middle income status. The decision to close our bilateral programme in Angola was agreed in 2008.

DFID has no country office or presence on the ground in Angola. The existing bilateral programme in Angola is managed through the DFID Southern Africa office in Pretoria, working closely with the British Embassy in Luanda. The programme now focuses on increasing the effectiveness of government expenditures on health systems to promote maternal and child health and strengthening urban governance and service delivery.

The two remaining projects which DFID is supporting are due to close at the end of March 2011.

DFID also supports Angola through two Southern Africa regional programmes, other central funds (e.g. the Governance and Transparency Fund and humanitarian funds) and through our imputed share of multilateral spending.
