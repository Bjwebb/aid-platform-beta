Tanzania is politically stable and has seen good economic growth over the last ten years, but this period has seen little reduction in income poverty. One in three people live on less than £7 a month.  The country has made strong progress in health, education and other basic services in the past decade, especially school enrolment with 90% of children going to primary school. But challenges remain to reach everyone in need across this large and sparsely populated nation.  We will spend an average of £161 million per year in Tanzania until 2015.

## Top priorities

- Building on the progress made in education
- Improving reproductive and maternal health
- Accelerating private sector development and job creation
