The decision to close our programme in Cameroon was agreed with the Government of Cameroon in 2008.  DFID has no office or staff based in Cameroon; the country office closed in 2004. Currently there is only one programme and this is focused solely on the forestry sector. The closure of this in 2011 will mark the end of our existing bilateral commitments in Cameroon.    

However, forestry is a vitally important area for Cameroon and we remain committed to providing ongoing support to countries in the region - including Cameroon - through the Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF) which the UK government was instrumental in setting up.  The UK will also continue to support Cameroon through the UK's increasing share of World Bank, African Development Bank, European Commission and other multilateral programming.
