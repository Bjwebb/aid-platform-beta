An unstable political settlement lies at the heart of Zimbabwe’s problems. Following a decade of economic collapse, recent recovery has not been matched by political progress.  We will spend an average of £88 million per year in Zimbabwe until 2015. But if political transition takes place during the period we will significantly scale up the development programme to help a reforming government.

## Top priorities

- Helping prepare the ground for credible elections which are essential if Zimbabwe is to benefit from a stable, accountable government which governs in the interests of all its people
- Creating more economic opportunities for the people of Zimbabwe
- Improving girls’ education, where our plan has the potential to transform a whole generation
- Improving maternal and child health and water and sanitation
