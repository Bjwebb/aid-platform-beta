After 10 years of helping to reduce poverty in Cambodia, DFID's office in Phnom Penh formally closed on 31 January 2011. We continue to provide significant levels of bilateral aid to Cambodia to support the Royal Government of Cambodia's efforts to reduce child and maternal mortality and to remove landmines.   DFID will continue to support areas such as health, HIV & AIDS, and poverty planning from the DFID Vietnam office.
