Vietnam has done very well in reducing poverty but challenges remain: 12 million people still live in poverty, the poverty rate among ethnic minorities is alarmingly high at over 50%, only half of the children attending primary school in ethnic minority areas reach the language standard required to enter lower secondary school, the MDG target on HIV/AIDS is off track and the target on sanitation may well be missed.

The UK commits to continue supporting Vietnam during the last five years of the 10-year Development Partnership Arrangement (DPA, 2011-2016). This support is predicated on continued commitment by the Government of Vietnam to poverty reduction; improved public financial management and anti-corruption; and respect for human rights, including domestic accountability.
