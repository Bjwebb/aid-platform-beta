The UK was one of the first to respond to the growing humanitarian crisis in Syria, providing vital food, medical care, shelter and other essential support to tens of thousands of people affected by the fighting in Syria and to more than 45,000 refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq.  In Syria, UK support is helping to deliver emergency food aid to 80,000 people a month, shelter for 9,000 families, and urgent medical care for at least 50,000 people across Syria and the region.  The UK has recently announced a further £9 million to support the UN response in Syria and the region, bringing the total UK support to £39.5 million.

We are also helping refugees in neighbouring countries. UK funding will help to provide trauma support and education for 28,000 children, emergency food rations for over 18,000 people, drinking water, sanitation and hygiene for over 33,000 refugees and basic supplies for mothers and babies.

The UK remains at the forefront of international efforts to support an effective response, led by the UN. We are the second largest bi-lateral donor of international humanitarian aid to the Syrian perople.
