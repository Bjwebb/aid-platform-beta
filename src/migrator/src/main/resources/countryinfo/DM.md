Dominica is a volcanic island in the eastern Caribbean. It has a population of around 70,000, and an economy heavily dependent on tourism and agriculture.   In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  As part of this, Dominica will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. UK aid will provide training and practical measures across the Caribbean such as safer buildings and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers, to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.

We are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and to integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions. Knowing what problems they face will make it easier for them to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.

The UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for Dominica and five other Caribbean countries. 

In line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:

£10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets.

£10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors

£4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.

CARTFund is helping Dominica's service industries to organise themselves into a national coalition, so that they can sell more services both domestically and in export markets.

COMPETE Caribbean is reviewing Dominica's existing strategy for promoting greater economic growth, by developing a five-year framework for growth and poverty reduction.  The Dominica financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.  

In common with the rest of the Caribbean, Dominica suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units in the eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.

The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2009, UK contributions that benefited Dominica amounted to £466,000.
